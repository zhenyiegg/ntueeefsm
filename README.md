# 🧠 NTUEEEFSM: Technology-Enhanced Learning for Finite State Machines

An interactive web-based platform developed by NTU Students for their Final Year Project with the aim of helping users with their learning and visualising Finite State Machines (FSMs) and their corresponding digital circuits. This tool helps users understand and convert between state machines (Moore/Mealy) and logic circuits through a user-friendly interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 **FSM-to-Circuit Conversion**: Visualize how Finite State Machines are represented as digital logic circuits.
- 🔄 **Circuit-to-FSM Conversion**: Reverse engineer logic circuits to their corresponding state machine representations.
- ⚙️ **Interactive UI**: Drag-and-drop state nodes and transitions with real-time feedback.
- 🌐 **Web-based**: Built entirely on modern web technologies for accessibility and responsiveness.
